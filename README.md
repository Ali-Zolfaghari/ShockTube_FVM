# ShockTube_FVM
The interest in studying the shock tube problem is threefold. From a fundamental point of view, it offers an interesting framework to introduce some basic notions about nonlinear hyperbolic systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). From a numerical point of view, this problem constitutes, since the exact solution is known, an inevitable and difficult test case for any numerical method dealing with discontinuous solutions. Finally, there is a practical interest, since this model is used to describe real shock tube experimental devices.
flow in the shock tube is described by the one-dimensional (1D) Euler system of PDEs (see, for instance, Hirsch, 1988; LeVeque, 1992).where œÅ is the density of the gas and E the total energy. To close this system of equations, we need to write the constitutive law of the gas (or equation of state).
